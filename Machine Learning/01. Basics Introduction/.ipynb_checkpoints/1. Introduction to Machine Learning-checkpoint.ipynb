    "    Machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or judgements based on data. In conventional programming, humans give explicit instructions to inform a machine how to do a certain task. Machine learning, on the other hand, allows a computer to learn from data and enhance its performance on a job without being specifically designed for it."

    "    Reinforcement Learning Algorithms : It's a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions to maximize a cumulative reward signal over time, and it learns through trial and error. Reinforcement learning is commonly used in scenarios where there is no labeled data, and the agent must learn to make sequential decisions. Here are some key characteristics and examples of reinforcement learning algorithms:\n",

    "            Actor-Critic Methods: These methods combine elements of both value-based (critic) and policy-based (actor) methods.
